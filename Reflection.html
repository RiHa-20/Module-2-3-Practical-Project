These two modules were really intreseting to learn information from. Learning about FTP, SnapTags, and NFC technology was really intresting. Since learning about FTP, I have downloaded FileZilla and am trying to learn how to use it when I have free time. I also have looked into NFC. It seems that NFC is going to be around for a long time as it makes payments at stores and other places a lot easier. I choose to use HTML for this project to get the practice and learn how to use HTML to create a site. Never having done HTML before it was intresting to do start creating a site through HTML. It was a bit difficult at first trying to create a site without ever doing it before but I have learned the basics in order to create this site.
