<h2> What I learned from Module 2</h2>
<p>
Module 2 was a very interesting module. There was a good amount of information that I already had a basic knowledge of and then there was a lot of new information that I learned as well. This module was very beneficial in learning all the different features that email services, like Gmail, include. Prior to this module, because I usually do not use my email that much, I did not know that you could add email contacts to your Gmail account yourself. All of my Gmail contacts were automatically saved by google from previous contacts. Additionally, in this module, I learned about File Transfer Protocol or FTP. FTP is an internet protocol that can be used to transfer files on the internet. FTP does requires a FTP  client which can be easily downloaded to a computer. Prior to this module I had not heard of or used FTP, but now I have downloaded FileZilla and I am trying to learn how to use it. FTP is really interesting and beneficial to those who need to transfer files to a wedpage, such as web designers and web developers.
