<h2> What I learned from Module 3</h2>
<p>
Module 3 was another interesting module. There was some information that I had already known about like QR codes and some of the Essential Eight. What I found to be really interesting was Near-field communication (NFC) technology because it can be very versatile as well as does not require its own power source. Today in the United States NFC is very common and most phones are NFC compatible you can use NFC technology to tap to pay for items when you are out at a store. Additionally, I learned about SnapTags was interesting too because I had seen them before but did not know they were like QR codes. Another item that caught my mind in this module was reading about WhatsApp and how they offer end-to-end encryption when you send messages which is different from regular SMS messaging which could be read by anyone. It's crazy to think that other people can read your messages when you text through SMS which we would think is private.
